# ColorFlexes
ColorFlexes iOS Game

ColorFlexes High School Project:
The Objective of the Game is to correctly identify the color of the text in the middle of the text 
in the middle of the screen. 
If you open the first picture in ColorFlexes/ColorFlexes Screenshots/ you will see an example of the gameplay screen.
The correct answer in this situation would be to press the yellow square instead of the green square.
While all of this is happening the user is put into a time crunch to get the correct answer because the 
game loops to another situation.

Currently the game needs to updated to current iOS software standards.
